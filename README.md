# Portfolio
Current examples of my work.
## Overview

As part of a class project, this website displays my skills and abilities as a full stack web developer. Thus far, I have learned (and still learning) to code with three main web development languages- HTML, CSS and JavaScript/jQuery. This project also incorporates some bootstrap components, which allow for a more interactive experience for the user. 

This responsive portfolio contains an About Me page, where I share some of my background, Portfolio Page, which displays my "coding/web development accomplishments", and a Contact Me page in case you would like to reach out for collaborations or project advice.
