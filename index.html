            <p>Hello and thank you for visiting my site. Since you're already here, might as well find out a little bit about me. I was born in Siberia, Russia. I lived there until I was almost 11 years old when my mom decided to move us to the United States. This was right after the break up of Communism and America seemed like a magical place where all your dreams come true. We moved to Reno, Nevada in 1994.</p>
            <p>At this point, my adventure was just beginning. I didn't know any English, but that didn't stop me from going to public school and diving into the ocean of slang, homonyms, idioms and more. With a lot of late nights and Saturday morning cartoons, I was able to become fluent in English in just six months. After High School, I attended a local college and received a Bachelors of Science in Biology. Growing up in an impoverished country that frequently had no access to basic necessities and then a small town with only two stop lights, I saw the world in a new light. During my second semester of college, I decided that it was time to give back and I joined the Air Force Narional Guard. I continued my enlistment throughout my entire education career from 2003 to 2013 when I graduated with a PhD in Cell and Molecular Biology. </p>
            <p>In December of 2019, I decided to make a career change and become a full stack web developer. I enrolled in a Full-Stack Web Developer Codidng Boot Camp through University of Minnesota to obtain a general overview of coding languages and what it takes to be a developer. Thus far, I have learned basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript/jQuery coding. I've been able to use these skills to create several interactive websites and work as a team on an API-driven application. A sample of my work can be seen in the Portfolio link.</p>
